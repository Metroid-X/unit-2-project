### About
I sould've been in way over my head when making this, and yet, _somehow_ I managed to pull it off.
TotalRecall Forums is just a fun spur-of-the-moment idea I had when we were first learning the ways of the CRUD, and I liked the idea of having a fun little forum for people to just post silly stuff on, and have always been more keen on that 'older-internet' forum look that many places have unfortunately decided to drop.
As weird as it might sound, I really liked the way that sites such as 2-, 4-, and 8-chan do things, and although I might not know exactly what makes those sites tick (nor did I actually do any in-depth research on the websites themselves), but I know what I like about them, and what I would add if it were up to me, so, that's basically what TotalRecall Forums ended up being!
\
\
_Disclaimer: I have no idea how to deploy the app at this time, so unfortunately, it's just me, myself, and I populating this forum._

_Above are both the wireframe and the current working model respectively_

Users can create an account in order to contribute to the fun! All it currently takes is a good username, displayname, and password. user avatars can be linked as urls to images in the sign-up process.

Each branch of the forums is easily accessible to users, along with a shortcut to creating new topics in each branch.

Users can differentiate eachother by custom displaynames (for security reasons, the option of the display name allows the user to keep their username secret)

Even when browsing the forums, users will easily be able to tell when they pass a topic or comment of their making by a pright blue 'halo' around their user avatar icon.
