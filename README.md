Users can create an account in order to contribute to the fun! All it currently takes is a good username, displayname, and password. user avatars can be linked as urls to images in the sign-up process.

Each branch of the forums is easily accessible to users, along with a shortcut to creating new topics in each branch.

Users can differentiate eachother by custom displaynames (for security reasons, the option of the display name allows the user to keep their username secret)

Even when browsing the forums, users will easily be able to tell when they pass a topic or comment of their making by a pright blue 'halo' around their user avatar icon.
